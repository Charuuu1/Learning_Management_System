# Learning Management System
The Learning Management System (LMS) is a robust platform built on a fusion of modern technologies. At its core, it harnesses the power of Node.js, enabling seamless server-side functionality with JavaScript. Leveraging MongoDB as its database, the system ensures efficient data storage and retrieval while utilizing Mongoose for streamlined interaction with the database.

The frontend design flourishes through the utilization of Bootstrap, allowing for a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Handlebars, known for its simplicity and flexibility, facilitates dynamic content rendering, enabling personalized experiences within the project.

This amalgamation of Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, and Handlebars within the dynamic web project ensures a comprehensive and adaptable system that empowers effective learning experiences.
